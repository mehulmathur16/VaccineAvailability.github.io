# COVID Vaccine Availability App
* This is a web application that fetches vaccination center details in India using Co-WIN public APIs.
* It provides details about all the vaccination centers of a district like doses available , fees , vaccine type , etc.  
* Users have to enter their state and district names, after entering they will be redirected to all the vaccination center details. 
* I also made this project because I was having difficulty in finding the available centers with a fee comparison. But in this app users also get to know about the fee and also about the type of vaccine. 
* I have used HTML , CSS and Javascript in this project.
* The app is hosted on :
